# Edges

A simple Lisp, in Rust.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steveklabnik/edges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steveklabnik/edges)

It's called Edges because Rust has sharp edges, and `()`s kinda look like the
edge of something. I'm bad at names.

## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/edges.git
$ cd edges
$ cargo run "(+ 1 1)"
```

This doesn't currently actually work. We'll get there.
