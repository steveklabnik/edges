# Edges

A port of [Peter Norvig's Lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) in Rust.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steveklabnik/edges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steveklabnik/edges)

It's called Edges because Rust has sharp edges, and `()`s kinda look like the
edge of something. I'm bad at names.

## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/edges.git
$ cd edges
$ cargo build
$ ./target/edges "(+ 1 1)"
```

This doens't currently actually work. We'll get there.
